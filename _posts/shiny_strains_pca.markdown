## Summary

This is project came about when the lab was trying to figure out which bacteria we should have sequenced. I used a high trough put methodology to rapidly screen different Pseudoalteromonas species for secondary metabolite production. In order to rapidly compare samples and dereplicate similar strains I developed the shiny app in R called [Shiny Stains](dschiriac.shinyapps.io/ShinyStrains/).

I will be posting on how to use the app shortly
