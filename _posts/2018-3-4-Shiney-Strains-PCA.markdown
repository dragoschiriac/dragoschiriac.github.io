## Summary

This is project came about when the lab was trying to figure out which bacteria we should sequence to see if it produced any novel natural products. I used high throughput SPE to rapidly screen different *Peudoalteromonas* species for secondary metabolite production. In order to rapidly compare samples ran through LC-MS and dereplicate similar strains I developed the shiny app in R called [Shiny Stains](https://dschiriac.shinyapps.io/ShinyStrains/).

## How to Use Shiny Strains

I will be posting on how to use the app shortly
