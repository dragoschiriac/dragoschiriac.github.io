## Summary

<p>To kick off my blog I am going to be talking a little bit about the natural product symposium the Ross
and Zechel labs are putting together at Queen's University.</p>

## Great Lakes Symposium

<p>The Great Lakes Symposium is meant to be a chance for students working in natural product discovery
to get together and discuss their research with like minded peers. It is hosted on the first weekend in May
in order to give students attending the Canadian Society for Chemistry conference a chance to practice their
talk or poster and receive critical feedback. I hope that in time this symposium can become a long standing tradition</p>

## Invited Speaker

<p>This year we are happy to announce that the guest speaker will be <a href="http://bowerslab.web.unc.edu/">Dr. Al Bowers</a>. Research in the Bowers Lab is concentrated on the synthesis, assessment, and modification of potential therapeutic leads, especially those derived from natural products.</p>
