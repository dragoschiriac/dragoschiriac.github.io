<p>Hello Everyone! My name is Dragos Chiriac and I am pursuing a MSc at Queen's University.
I work on natural product discovery under Avena Ross in the Department of Chemistry.
I consider myself a jack of all trades that likes to split his time between running experiments and coding.
My research is focused on genomic mining of natural products, rapid screening via mass spectrometry, and bridging the two together with machine learning. You can check out some of my projects by following the link above</p>

<p>My goal is to one day be able to use engineered organisms to easily produce commodity chemicals. I think that there are a few problems that need to be solved along the way such as de novo enzyme design and rapid assembly of complex genetic circuits. These challenging problems are what drive me and sculpt my research</p>
