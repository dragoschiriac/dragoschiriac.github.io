<p>Hello Everyone! My name is Dragos Chiriac and I am pursuing a MSc at Queen's University.
I work on natural product discovery under Avena Ross in the Department of Chemistry.
I consider myself a jack of all trades and like to split my time between running experiments and coding.
My research is focused on genomic mining of natural products, rapid screening via mass spectrometry, and bridging the two together with machine learning. You can check out some of my projects by using the tab at the top</p>
